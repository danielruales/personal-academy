**Answers**  
1. (Answers for Chapter 1) 1. RNNs are sequential models ideal for tasks where order matters, but they struggle with long-term dependencies; Transformers overcome this with self-attention, allowing better handling of context. 2. In healthcare, GPT-3 may face regulatory hurdles and patient data concerns; in finance, model accuracy and compliance are paramount. 3. Pre-training offers generalized understanding, while fine-tuning tailors models for specific tasks (e.g., customer support chatbots vs medical diagnosis).  
2. (Answers for Chapter 2) 1. Tokenization segment texts into manageable pieces, necessary for model training (e.g., word-level vs subword). 2. NER speeds up data processing in legal document parsing (contracts) or news aggregation (identifying people/locations). 3. Assess sentiment accuracy via precision and recall calculations based on predicted vs actual sentiments from your chosen dataset.  
3. (Answers for Chapter 3) 1. Bias can mislead LLM results, leading to discrimination (e.g., gender bias in hiring tools); strategies include diverse datasets and active monitoring. 2. Normalization adjusts data scales, while embeddings capture semantic similarity, both crucial for model comprehension. 3. Any preprocessing pipeline (e.g., removing stop words) can hinder context retention, impacting outcomes.  
4. (Answers for Chapter 4) 1. Precision focuses on correct positive predictions, recall emphasizes capturing all positives, and F1-score balances both; vital for commercial applications like spam detection. 2.
